# Credits and sponsoring

The original script version was developed by Alessandro Bacciottini and Arjan Feta for the Università degli Studi di Firenze (UNIFI).

In 2021, it has been completely refactored to work under QGIS 3, with a simple installation and usage workflow even for Windows users. This work has been developed by Oslandia (<https://www.oslandia.com>) and sponsored by ANR - Programme ERASEd - ANR-18-CE03-0001-01, through IRD, the *Institut de Recherche pour le Développement* (the French National Research Institute for Sustainable Development).
